Numba Integration Testing
=========================

As part of the continuous quality assurance of the `Numba project
<https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ we test the compatibility of Numba with the
latests releases of specific dependents, i.e. libraries that make heavy use of
Numba. The target Numba version to test with, will be the latest version of the
git ``master`` branch where the test suite passed. Configurations for both
`CircleCI <https://circleci.com/>`_  and `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_
are provided but currently (April 2020) only the CircleCI configuration is
active.

    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/numba/numba-integration-testing/tree/master

This setup uses `TexasBBQ <https://github.com/numba/texasbbq>`_ under the hood.

* `numba-dppy <https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dppy>`_

Adding a new Target
===================

In order to add a new target, you need to:

* Implement the logic for the target, by subclassing ``texasbbq.CondaTarget``
  or ``texasbbq.GitTarget`` in the file ``switchboard.py`` and overloading
  necessary methods.
* Add an appropriate stanza in the CI configuration file
  ``.circleci/config.yml``.
* Updating the ``README.rst`` to reflect the current list of projects being
  tested.
* Submit a pull-request on Github.

Testing a Branch or Pull-Request
================================

Normally, Numba is installed as a conda packge from https://anaconda.org using
a ``CondaSource`` configuration. However, sometimes it can be useful to run the
integration-testing from a branch or a pull-request. The following
configuration demonstrates how to obtain the branch ``refactor_it`` from the
Github fork at ``github.com/esc/numba``.

Please be advised that you must mirror the tags of the upstream Numba
repository at ``github.com/numba/numba`` to the desired fork in such cases.
This is because the Numba version is determined from the closest reachable
tag in the Git history so recent tags must be present for the build system
to accurately determine the Numba version. Otherwise you may end up with a
nonsensical version number that is likely to cause confusion.
